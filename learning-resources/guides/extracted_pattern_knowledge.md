# Comprehensive Design Pattern Guidance
## Extracted from Jupyter Notebook Analysis

This document provides specific, actionable guidance for design pattern selection and implementation based on comprehensive analysis of 10 design pattern tutorials.

---

## 1. Singleton Pattern üîê

### When to Use Criteria
- **Database connections** - Expensive to create, should be shared
- **Configuration settings** - One source of truth needed
- **Logging systems** - Centralized logging required
- **Caching mechanisms** - Shared cache across application

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **You just want global variables** - Use modules instead
- **Testing is important** - Singletons are hard to test and mock
- **You might need multiple instances later** - Don't paint yourself into a corner
- **Simple objects** - Don't over-engineer basic data structures

### Thread Safety Requirements
- **Use threading.Lock()** for multi-threaded applications
- **Double-check locking pattern** - Check instance exists, acquire lock, check again
- **Performance consideration** - First check without lock for efficiency

### Common Mistakes
- **Not handling thread safety** - Multiple instances created in concurrent environments
- **Using for data objects** - Never make User, Product, etc. as singletons
- **Overuse** - Creating singletons when regular classes suffice

### Testing Implications
- **Hard to mock** - Global state makes unit testing difficult
- **State pollution** - Tests can affect each other
- **Consider alternatives** - Dependency injection for better testability

## 2. Factory Pattern üè≠

### When to Use Criteria
- **3+ similar classes** that do the same job differently
- **Complex object creation** requiring multiple steps or decisions
- **Configuration-driven creation** - Object type depends on config files or user input
- **Need to switch implementations** at runtime

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Only one class** - Don't create a factory for just one type
- **Simple object creation** - If `MyClass()` is simple enough, don't add factory overhead
- **Over-engineering** - Don't add factories "just in case"
- **Performance critical** - Factories add small overhead

### Complexity Thresholds
- **Consider if/else for 2-3 cases** - Factory becomes valuable at 3+ implementations
- **Abstract Factory** for families of related objects (AWS services, UI themes)

### Decision Criteria
- Use **Simple Factory** for basic object creation
- Use **Factory Method** when subclasses decide what to create
- Use **Abstract Factory** for families of related products

### Alternative Solutions
- **Function parameters** for small variations
- **Enums with switch statements** for fixed options
- **Configuration files** for simple behavior changes

---

## 3. Observer Pattern üëÅÔ∏è

### When to Use Criteria
- **Model-View architectures** - Views need to update when model changes
- **Event-driven systems** - User actions, system events, notifications
- **Real-time updates** - Stock prices, chat applications, live dashboards
- **One-to-many relationships** - One subject, many observers

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Simple data binding** - Direct references might be simpler
- **Performance critical** - Observer pattern adds notification overhead
- **Complex update sequences** - Order dependencies make it confusing
- **Only one observer** - Direct method calls are clearer

### Performance Considerations
- **Push vs Pull models** - Push is efficient, Pull is flexible
- **Large observer lists** - Consider asynchronous notifications
- **Memory leaks** - Ensure observers are properly removed

### Threading Implications
- **Thread-safe notifications** - Protect observer list with locks
- **Separate lock for data** - Don't block notifications while updating data
- **Async event handling** - Consider event queues for complex scenarios

### Common Mistakes
- **Forgetting to unsubscribe** - Leads to memory leaks
- **Circular dependencies** - Observer A updates Observer B which updates A
- **Complex update chains** - Hard to debug event propagation

## 4. Strategy Pattern üéØ

### When to Use Criteria
- **3+ algorithms** for the same problem (sorting, compression, pathfinding)
- **Runtime algorithm switching** - Choose based on data or user preference
- **Eliminating conditionals** - Replace long if/else chains with strategies
- **A/B testing** - Easily switch between different implementations

### Complexity Thresholds
- **Use when you have 3+ algorithms** solving the same problem
- **Consider if/else for 2-3 cases** - Strategy pattern valuable at 3+ options
- **Data-driven selection** - Algorithm choice depends on input characteristics

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Only one algorithm** - Don't create strategies for single implementations
- **Simple variations** - Use parameters instead of separate strategies
- **Algorithms rarely change** - If you'll never switch, don't add overhead
- **Performance critical** - Strategy pattern adds method call overhead

### Decision Criteria
- **Multiple sorting algorithms** - Choose based on data size
- **Different compression strategies** - Select based on file type and priorities
- **Smart strategy selection** - Automatic choice based on context

### Alternative Solutions
- **Function parameters** for small variations
- **Configuration objects** for behavior customization
- **Template methods** for algorithms with similar structure

### Testing Benefits
- **Individual strategy testing** - Each algorithm can be tested separately
- **Easy mocking** - Mock strategies for unit testing context
- **A/B testing support** - Switch strategies for performance comparison

## 5. Decorator Pattern üé®

### When to Use Criteria
- **Add responsibilities dynamically** - Wrap objects with additional behavior
- **Multiple feature combinations** - Avoid class explosion
- **Transparent enhancement** - Client doesn't need to know about decoration
- **Composable behaviors** - Stack multiple decorators

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Component interface is too complex** - Decorators need to implement all methods
- **Fixed set of combinations** - Regular inheritance might be simpler
- **Performance critical** - Each decorator adds indirection layer
- **Simple objects** - Don't over-engineer basic data

### Complexity Thresholds
- **3+ optional features** - Decorator becomes valuable
- **Avoid for simple objects** - Don't decorate basic data containers
- **Consider inheritance for 2-3 features** - Decorator overhead not worth it

### Real-world Applications
- **Text processing pipelines** - Clean, format, validate text
- **I/O streams** - BufferedReader, DataInputStream
- **Web middleware** - Authentication, logging, compression
- **Coffee shop example** - Add milk, sugar, whip cream combinations

### Testing Implications
- **Test individual decorators** - Each decorator can be tested separately
- **Test decorator combinations** - Verify stacking works correctly
- **Mock underlying components** - Test decorator logic in isolation

## 6. Command Pattern üéÆ

### When to Use Criteria
- **Undo/redo operations** - Commands store state for reversal
- **Macro recording** - Combine multiple commands
- **Queue operations** - Store commands for later execution
- **Logging and auditing** - Track all operations performed

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Simple operations** - Don't create commands for basic method calls
- **No undo needed** - If operations are irreversible and logging not needed
- **Performance critical** - Command objects add overhead
- **Tight coupling acceptable** - When invoker can directly call receiver

### Complexity Thresholds
- **Use for complex operations** that need undo/redo
- **Overkill for simple actions** like basic getters/setters
- **Valuable for GUI applications** with menu/button actions

### Advanced Scenarios
- **Macro commands** - Combine multiple commands for complex operations
- **Command queues** - Store and execute commands asynchronously
- **Transaction support** - Group commands with rollback capability

### Testing Benefits
- **Individual command testing** - Each command can be tested separately
- **Mock receivers** - Test command logic without real receivers
- **Undo testing** - Verify commands can be properly reversed

## 7. Repository Pattern üìö

### When to Use Criteria
- **Centralize data access logic** - Single place for all database operations
- **Multiple data sources** - Switch between SQL, NoSQL, files, APIs
- **Domain-driven design** - Separate business logic from data concerns
- **Extensive unit testing** - Mock repositories for business logic tests

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Simple applications** with minimal data access
- **ORM already provides abstraction** - Don't add another layer
- **Very specific queries** tightly coupled to database
- **Performance critical** - Repository pattern adds abstraction overhead

### Testing Benefits
- **Easy mocking** - Mock repositories for unit tests
- **In-memory testing** - Use in-memory repositories for fast tests
- **Business logic isolation** - Test business rules without database

### Multiple Implementation Examples
- **SqliteUserRepository** - SQLite database implementation
- **InMemoryUserRepository** - Fast in-memory testing
- **JsonFileUserRepository** - File-based storage
- **ExternalAPIRepository** - Remote API integration

### Advanced Patterns
- **Unit of Work** - Manage transactions across repositories
- **Specification pattern** - Build complex queries dynamically
- **Repository aggregates** - Handle related entities together

---

## 8. Builder Pattern üèóÔ∏è

### When to Use Criteria
- **Many optional parameters** - More than 4-5 constructor parameters
- **Complex object construction** - Multi-step construction process
- **Different object representations** - Same construction, different results
- **Immutable objects** with complex initialization

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Few properties** - Simple constructor or factory method sufficient
- **Construction doesn't vary** - If building process is always the same
- **Simple objects** - Don't over-engineer basic data containers

### Complexity Thresholds
- **5+ constructor parameters** - Builder becomes valuable
- **3+ optional features** - Builder better than multiple constructors
- **Validation at each step** - Builder allows incremental validation

### Advanced Features
- **Fluent interface** - Method chaining for readability
- **Validation builders** - Check constraints during construction
- **SQL Query builders** - Dynamic query construction
- **Configuration builders** - Complex configuration objects

### Testing Benefits
- **Step-by-step testing** - Test each building step separately
- **Validation testing** - Verify constraints at each step
- **Different configurations** - Easy to test various object configurations

## 9. Adapter Pattern üîå

### When to Use Criteria
- **Incompatible interfaces** - Existing class with wrong interface
- **Third-party library integration** - Adapt external libraries
- **Legacy system integration** - Make old systems work with new code
- **Multiple data formats** - Convert between different formats

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Interfaces already compatible** - No adaptation needed
- **Can modify existing classes** - Direct modification is simpler
- **Adaptation logic too complex** - Better handled differently
- **Performance overhead significant** - Direct integration preferred

### Types of Adapters
- **Object Adapter** (composition) - More flexible, can't override adaptee methods
- **Class Adapter** (inheritance) - Less flexible, can override adaptee methods
- **Two-way Adapter** - Works in both directions

### Real-world Applications
- **Database drivers** - JDBC, ODBC adapters
- **File format converters** - CSV to JSON, XML to JSON
- **Payment gateways** - Unify different payment APIs
- **Media players** - Support multiple audio/video formats

### Testing Benefits
- **Mock adaptees** - Test adapter logic without real dependencies
- **Interface compliance** - Verify adapter implements target interface correctly
- **Error handling** - Test adapter behavior with invalid input

---

## 10. State Pattern üé∞

### When to Use Criteria
- **Behavior depends on state** - Object acts differently based on internal state
- **Complex state transitions** - Well-defined rules for state changes
- **Eliminate state conditionals** - Replace complex if/else chains
- **Finite state machines** - Clear, enumerable states

### When NOT to Use Criteria
- **Few states** with simple behavior
- **State changes are rare** or logic is simple
- **Simple conditional logic** - If/else might be clearer
- **No clear state transitions** - States don't follow defined rules

### Complexity Thresholds
- **3+ states** with different behaviors - State pattern becomes valuable
- **Complex transition rules** - State pattern clarifies relationships
- **State-specific data** - Each state needs different information

### Advanced Scenarios
- **State machines** - Formal finite state machine implementation
- **Workflow systems** - Document approval, order processing
- **Game development** - Player states, AI behaviors
- **UI components** - Button states (normal, hover, pressed, disabled)

### Common Mistakes
- **Too many small states** - Don't create state for every minor variation
- **States knowing too much** - Keep states focused on their behavior
- **Missing transitions** - Ensure all valid state changes are handled

- **State** - Object delegation per operation
- **Command** - Object creation per operation

### Higher Overhead Patterns
- **Observer** - Notification to multiple observers
- **Decorator** - Multiple layers of indirection
- **Adapter** - Translation overhead

### Optimization Strategies
- **Pool Command objects** - Reuse command instances
- **Async Observer notifications** - Don't block for slow observers
- **Cache Strategy instances** - Reuse strategy objects
- **Lazy initialization** - Create states/decorators only when needed

---

## Testing Strategies by Pattern

### Easy to Test
- **Strategy** - Mock strategies, test context independently
- **Command** - Mock receivers, test commands separately
- **Repository** - Mock repositories, use in-memory implementations

### Moderate Testing Complexity
- **Observer** - Mock observers, test notification logic
- **State** - Test state transitions, mock state actions
- **Factory** - Test creation logic, verify correct instances

### Challenging to Test
- **Singleton** - Global state, hard to isolate
- **Decorator** - Multiple layers, complex interaction testing
- **Adapter** - Integration testing required

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Use dependency injection** instead of Singletons
2. **Mock external dependencies** in adapters
3. **Test state transitions** explicitly in State pattern
4. **Verify observer cleanup** to prevent memory leaks
5. **Test decorator combinations** for proper behavior
