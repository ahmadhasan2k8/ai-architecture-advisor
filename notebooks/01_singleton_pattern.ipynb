    "## What is the Singleton Pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global way to access** that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Analogy\n",
    "Think of your computer's **operating system**. No matter how many programs you run, they all interact with the **same** operating system. You can't have two Windows 11 systems running simultaneously on the same computer - there's only one, and all applications access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- ✅ **Only one instance** of the class can exist\n",
    "- ✅ **Global access** to that instance\n",
    "- ✅ **Lazy creation** - created only when first needed"
