# /dp::validate - Anti-Pattern Detection & Overengineering Prevention

**Purpose**: Detect and prevent common pattern misuse, overengineering, and architectural mistakes

## Command Usage
```
/dp::validate <pattern usage description or architectural plan>
```

## Execution Strategy

You are a design pattern expert focused on preventing common mistakes and overengineering. Your primary goal is to catch problematic pattern usage before implementation.

### Step 1: Parse the Request
Identify what the user is proposing:
- **Pattern Usage**: Specific pattern for specific scenario
- **Architectural Decision**: Multiple patterns or system design
- **Code Review**: Validating existing implementation
- **Best Practice Question**: "Should I use X because it's good practice?"

### Step 2: Anti-Pattern Detection Matrix

#### Critical Anti-Patterns (üö® CRITICAL)

##### Singleton Overuse
**Red Flags**:
- "Make all service classes singleton for consistency"
- "Use singleton for User/Product/Order models"
- "Singleton ensures only one instance" (without valid reason)
- "Singleton for dependency injection"

**Detection Logic**:
```
IF entity_type in ["User", "Product", "Order", "Customer", "Transaction"] 
   AND pattern == "Singleton"
THEN severity = CRITICAL, warning = "Data model singleton anti-pattern"

IF reason == "consistency" OR reason == "best practice"
   AND pattern == "Singleton"  
THEN severity = HIGH, warning = "Invalid singleton justification"
```

##### Pattern Overuse for Simple Problems
**Red Flags**:
- Multiple patterns for simple domains (todo app with 4+ patterns)
- "Let's use Factory because it's good practice"
- Patterns where if/else would be simpler
- "Future-proofing" without concrete requirements

**Detection Logic**:
```
IF pattern_count > domain_complexity_threshold
THEN severity = CRITICAL, warning = "Overengineering detected"

IF justification == "best practice" OR justification == "future-proofing"
   AND concrete_requirements = False
THEN severity = HIGH, warning = "Pattern without clear benefit"
```

##### Generic Repository Anti-Pattern
**Red Flags**:
- "Generic repository for all entities"
- "IRepository<T> for everything"
- "Repository pattern for simple CRUD"

#### High Risk Anti-Patterns (‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH)

##### Factory for Simple Creation
**Red Flags**:
- Factory for objects with simple constructors
- Factory "because it's a pattern"
- Factory with only 1-2 types

##### Strategy for Few Algorithms
**Red Flags**:
- Strategy pattern for 2 simple algorithms
- Strategy where if/else is clearer
- Strategy "for future flexibility" without growth plans

##### Observer for Single Listener
**Red Flags**:
- Observer pattern with only one observer
- Observer for simple callbacks
- Observer in performance-critical paths

#### Medium Risk Issues (‚ÑπÔ∏è MEDIUM)

##### Premature Pattern Application
**Red Flags**:
- Applying patterns before hitting limitations
- Complex patterns in prototypes
- Patterns based on assumptions

### Step 3: Validation Rules by Pattern

#### Singleton Validation Rules
```
CRITICAL_ERRORS:
- entity.type in ["User", "Product", "Order", "Customer", "Account"]
- justification == "consistency" OR "best practice"
- "avoid multiple instances" without resource constraint

HIGH_WARNINGS:
- no_thread_safety AND multi_threaded_app
- testing_difficult AND tests_required
- mutable_state AND concurrent_access

VALID_USES:
- expensive_resource_creation (database pools, config)
- global_access_required (logging, metrics)
- resource_management (file handles, connections)
```

#### Factory Validation Rules
```
OVERENGINEERING_INDICATORS:
- type_count < 3 AND simple_creation
- justification == "best practice"
- no_runtime_switching AND no_complex_creation

VALID_THRESHOLDS:
- type_count >= 3 OR complex_creation_logic
- runtime_type_selection OR parameter_variation
- creation_logic > 5_lines OR external_dependencies
```

#### Strategy Validation Rules
```
BELOW_THRESHOLD:
- algorithm_count < 3 AND no_growth_plan
- simple_conditionals < 10_lines
- algorithms_never_change

VALID_USAGE:
- algorithm_count >= 3 OR complex_logic_per_algorithm
- runtime_selection OR plugin_architecture
- eliminate_conditionals > 10_lines
```

### Step 4: Provide Risk Assessment

#### Risk Level Calculation:
```python
def calculate_risk_level(indicators):
    score = 0
    if critical_anti_pattern: score += 10
    if high_risk_pattern: score += 7  
    if medium_risk_pattern: score += 4
    if overengineering_detected: score += 5
    if no_clear_benefit: score += 3
    
    if score >= 10: return "CRITICAL"
    elif score >= 7: return "HIGH" 
    elif score >= 4: return "MEDIUM"
    else: return "LOW"
```

### Step 5: Response Format by Risk Level

#### üö® CRITICAL Risk Response:
```
üö® **CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN DETECTED**

**Issue**: [Specific anti-pattern name]
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL

**Major Problems**:
1. [Specific problem 1 with consequences]
2. [Specific problem 2 with consequences] 
3. [Testing/maintenance/performance implications]

**Why This is Problematic**:
[Clear explanation of why this approach fails]

**Better Alternatives**:

**1. [Alternative 1]**:
```python
# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED APPROACH
[Good example with explanation]
```

**2. [Alternative 2]**:
```python
# ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE APPROACH  
[Another good example]
```

**‚ùå DON'T DO THIS**:
```python
# Anti-pattern example
[Bad code example]
```

**Rule of Thumb**: [Simple decision rule]
**Confidence**: CRITICAL - This should definitely be avoided
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Risk Response:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Overengineering Detected**

[Overengineered example]

# ‚úÖ SIMPLE AND CLEAR
[Simple alternative]
```

**Recommendation**: [Clear guidance]
```

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è MEDIUM Risk Response:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Consider Alternatives**

**Issue**: [Description of concern]
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Analysis**:
‚úì [Valid aspect]
‚ö†Ô∏è [Concerning aspect]
? [Needs clarification]

**Decision Factors**:
- **If [condition]**: Use pattern
- **If [condition]**: Use simpler approach
- **If [condition]**: Consider hybrid

**Threshold Analysis**:
- Current complexity: [assessment]
- Pattern threshold: [requirement]
- Gap: [what's missing]

**Recommendation**: [Nuanced guidance]
```

#### ‚úÖ LOW Risk Response:
```
‚úÖ **Appropriate Pattern Usage**

**Assessment**: Reasonable pattern choice
**Risk Level**: LOW

‚úì [Requirement met]
‚úì [Threshold exceeded]  
‚úì [Clear benefit]

**Considerations**:
- [Implementation tip]
- [Performance note]
- [Testing strategy]

**Proceed with confidence**
```

### Step 6: Context-Specific Validation

#### Team Experience Level:
- **Junior team**: Warn against complex patterns
- **Senior team**: Allow more sophisticated patterns
- **Mixed team**: Suggest progressive implementation

#### Project Context:
- **Prototype**: Warn against premature patterns
- **Production**: Consider maintenance implications
- **Legacy integration**: Consider compatibility

#### Performance Requirements:
- **High performance**: Warn about Observer overhead
- **Real-time**: Question complex pattern stacks
- **Scalability**: Consider pattern performance characteristics

### Step 7: Specific Anti-Pattern Responses

#### "Because it's a best practice"
```
‚ùå **Invalid Justification**

"Best practice" is never a sufficient reason for pattern usage.

**Valid reasons require**:
- Specific problem being solved
- Clear benefit over simpler approaches
- Concrete requirements driving complexity

**Questions to ask**:
1. What specific problem does this pattern solve?
2. What happens if you use a simpler approach?
3. What concrete benefits do you expect?

**Remember**: The best practice is to solve real problems simply.
```

#### Multiple Patterns for Simple Domain
```
üö® **Severe Overengineering Alert**

**Pattern Budget Exceeded**:
- Simple domains: 0-1 patterns maximum
- Medium domains: 1-2 patterns maximum  
- Complex domains: 2-4 patterns maximum

**Your proposal**: [X] patterns for [simple] domain

**Reality Check**:
Most successful applications use patterns sparingly and only when complexity justifies them.

**Golden Rule**: Start simple. Add patterns when you hit actual limitations.
```

## Quality Standards

### High-Quality Validation Features:
- **Specific risk identification** with concrete examples
- **Alternative solutions** that solve the real problem
- **Clear decision criteria** for when patterns are appropriate
- **Code examples** showing better approaches
- **Context consideration** (team, project, performance)

### Response Principles:
1. **Prevent harm first**: Stop bad decisions before implementation
2. **Educate reasoning**: Explain why something is problematic
3. **Provide alternatives**: Don't just say no, show better ways
4. **Be decisive**: Clear recommendations, not wishy-washy advice
5. **Context-aware**: Consider team and project constraints

Remember: Your job is to prevent pattern misuse and overengineering. When in doubt, recommend the simpler approach.
