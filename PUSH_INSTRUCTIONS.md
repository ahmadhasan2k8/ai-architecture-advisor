# Push to GitHub Instructions

Since we need authentication to push to GitHub, please follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "design-patterns-push"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Generate the token and copy it

2. Push using the token:
   ```bash
   # Set up the remote with your token
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/ahmadhasan2k8/design-patterns-tutorial.git
   
   # Push the code
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using SSH

1. If you have SSH keys set up:
   ```bash
   # Change remote to SSH
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ahmadhasan2k8/design-patterns-tutorial.git
   
   # Push the code
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

1. If you have GitHub CLI installed:
   ```bash
   # Authenticate
   gh auth login
   
   # Push using gh
   gh repo clone ahmadhasan2k8/design-patterns-tutorial
   cd design-patterns-tutorial
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## After Pushing

Once you've pushed the code, check the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ahmadhasan2k8/design-patterns-tutorial/actions
2. You should see the "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow running
3. It will run through all the validation steps:
   - Code validation
   - Tests
   - Notebook validation
   - Docker build
   - Quality checks

The workflow should take about 3-5 minutes to complete.

## Expected CI/CD Steps

The pipeline will:
1. âœ… Validate project structure and notebooks
2. âœ… Run linting and type checking
3. âœ… Execute all 689 tests
4. âœ… Test notebook execution
5. âœ… Build and test Docker image
6. âœ… Run quality gates

All steps should pass with green checkmarks! ðŸŽ‰
