# Quick Start: AI Architecture Advisor ü§ñ

**Get AI-powered architecture recommendations for your code in 5 minutes.**

## What This Tool Does

The AI Architecture Advisor analyzes your code and provides expert recommendations on:
- **Design patterns** to use (and when not to use them)
- **Anti-patterns** to avoid and how to fix them  
- **Architecture decisions** with confidence levels
- **Refactoring opportunities** with impact assessment

## Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

1. **Install Claude Code** ([Get it here](https://claude.ai/code))
2. **Clone and setup this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmadhasan2k8/ai-architecture-advisor.git
   cd ai-architecture-advisor
   ./setup.sh  # This installs the dp:: commands globally
   ```
3. **That's it!** You can now use dp:: commands from ANY directory

## 4 AI Commands - Your New Architecture Toolkit

### üß† `/dp::analyze` - Deep Architecture Analysis
**Use when**: You have complex architectural decisions to make

```bash
/dp::analyze Payment processing system with Credit Card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Bank Transfer. Each has different validation, fees, processing times, and error handling.
```

**What you get**: 8-step AI analysis with pattern recommendations, confidence levels, implementation guidance, and alternatives.

---

### ‚ö° `/dp::check` - Quick Pattern Validation  
**Use when**: You want to validate a specific pattern choice

```bash
/dp::check singleton for database connection pool in multi-threaded web application
```

**What you get**: Fast validation with clear ‚úÖ/‚ùå recommendation and reasoning.

---

### üîç `/dp::refactor` - Code Analysis for Opportunities
**Use when**: You want to improve existing code

```bash
/dp::refactor /path/to/your/project/src/main.py
```

**What you get**: Specific refactoring opportunities with priority scores and before/after examples.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è `/dp::validate` - Anti-Pattern Prevention
**Use when**: You want to prevent architectural mistakes

```bash
/dp::validate Making all my service classes singletons for consistency
```

**What you get**: Risk assessment with alternatives to avoid overengineering.

## Real-World Example

**Input:**
```bash
/dp::analyze E-commerce system with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, payment handling, and inventory management. Growing team of 8 developers.
```

**AI Output:**
```
üß† Pattern Analysis: E-commerce Platform Architecture

## Problem Assessment
- Complexity: High (6+ major domains, 8 developers)  
- Scale: Multi-domain system with team coordination needs
- Growth Potential: High (e-commerce systems evolve rapidly)

## Pattern Evaluation
### Primary Recommendations:

1. **Repository Pattern** (Confidence: HIGH)
   - Separate data access for User, Product, Order, Inventory
   - Enable independent testing and team development
   - Implementation: Create domain-specific repositories

2. **Strategy Pattern** for Payment Processing (Confidence: HIGH)  
   - Multiple payment methods with different logic
   - Runtime selection based on user preference/region
   - Implementation: PaymentProcessor interface with concrete strategies

3. **Observer Pattern** for Order Events (Confidence: MEDIUM)
   - Inventory updates, email notifications, analytics
   - Decoupled event handling across domains
   - Implementation: Domain events with multiple subscribers

## Anti-Pattern Warnings:
‚ùå Avoid generic repository (IRepository<T>) - use domain-specific
‚ùå Don't make everything singleton - conflicts with testing

## Implementation Priority:
1. Repository pattern (foundational)
2. Payment strategies (business critical)  
3. Event system (quality of life)

## Your First 5 Minutes

1. **Open Claude Code** from any project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   claude .
   ```
2. **Try the analyzer** on your current project:
   ```bash
   /dp::refactor main.py  # Or any file in your project
   ```
3. **Get architectural advice** for a challenge you're facing:
   ```bash
   /dp::analyze [Describe your architectural challenge]
   ```
4. **Validate a pattern decision** you're considering:
   ```bash
   /dp::check [pattern] for [your specific use case]
   ```

## What Makes This Different

‚ùå **Other tools**: Generic advice, theoretical examples  
‚úÖ **AI Architecture Advisor**: Analyzes YOUR code, YOUR problems

‚ùå **Other tools**: "Here's how to implement Factory pattern"  
‚úÖ **AI Architecture Advisor**: "Don't use Factory here - your 2 types don't justify the complexity. Use simple functions instead."

‚ùå **Other tools**: Tutorial-focused learning  
‚úÖ **AI Architecture Advisor**: Decision-focused problem solving

## Need to Learn the Patterns?

After getting AI recommendations, dive deeper with our comprehensive learning resources in the `learning-resources/` directory:
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks  
- Real-world examples
- Implementation guides
- Anti-pattern galleries

## Troubleshooting

**"Commands not working"**: Run `./setup.sh` from the ai-architecture-advisor directory  
**"Command not found"**: Make sure you ran setup.sh and restart Claude Code  
**"No sequential thinking"**: Update Claude Code to latest version  
**"Want to analyze private code"**: The AI only reads what you specify - your code stays secure
